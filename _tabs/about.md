**Heya**, I'm _Bernardo_, a self-taught Site Reliability Engineer at Zenvia.

I'm currently working with Kubernetes, AWS, Terraform (...eks, ecr, prometheus, grafana, etc.). However, `I'm just learning,`. Most of the stuff I do is new **(for me)**. This blog is a way for me to save my learning steps and force me to document **everything**. 

As you are already here - here's my background:

- Customer Success Specialist at Hostinger (Junior and Mid Level)
- Technical Support Specialist at Hostinger
- Technical Support Specialist at HostPapa
- Jr. Site Reliability Engineer at Zenvia

I've been working with computers for quite some time, however. My entire childhood was based in **playing stuff** and trying to **build stuff**. I've learned React, NodeJS, Vue, React Native and... _Visual Basic_ in this meantime. Quite a ride!

Hop on, let's learn together!
